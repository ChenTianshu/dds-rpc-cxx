RCP over DDS C++ API

In December 2014, OMG adopted (but not finalized) the RPC-over-DDS specification. The following files are part of the normative specification.

1. function_call.h 
2. request_reply.h
3. sample.h
4. RobotControlSupport.h (shows an example of what's normative in a "Support" class. RobotControl itself is not normative.)
