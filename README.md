RCP over DDS C++ API

In December 2014, OMG adopted (but not finalized) the RPC-over-DDS specification. The following files are part of the normative specification.

1. normative/function_call.h 
2. normative/request_reply.h
3. normative/sample.h
4. ./RobotControlSupport.h (shows an example of what's normative in a "Support" class. RobotControl itself is not normative.)

### C++ await 

If you are testing C++ await feature in Visual Studio 2015, use x64Win64VS2015 libaries.
